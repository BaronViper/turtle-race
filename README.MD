# Turtle Race
A simple game of betting which colored turtle will reach the other end of the screen first. Results are fully randomized for every race.

## Mechanics
1. A popup will appear asking for which turtle the user thinks will win. Options are "red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple." Invalid arguments will re-prompt the user to answer agan.
2. Sit back and enjoy the race!
