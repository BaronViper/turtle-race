# Turtle Race
Turtle Race is a simple game written in Python that uses the Turtle graphics library. In the game, players bet on which colored turtle they think will reach the right-end of the screen first. The available colored turtles are "red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple."

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the **'turtle_race.py'** file using your Python interpreter. You will be prompted to select a colored turtle to bet on. Once you have selected a turtle, the race will start and the turtle you bet on will try to reach the right-end of the screen first. If your turtle wins, you will win the game.
